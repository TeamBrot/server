## Description

This project contains a server program to emulate the official test environment found unter `wss://msoll.de/spe_ed`. It provides the standard WebSocket game API (`/spe_ed`) as well as the time API (`/spe_ed_time`). It creates a web server that hosts a GUI visualizing the game. The GUI can be accessed under `http://localhost:8081`. 

The server supports one game at a time. It does not check the client's responses for timeouts. Therefore, it should only be used in development.

## Installation

### 0. Prerequisites

Our software is written in go. So you need a fully functional go installation. Information about how to set thi up you find ![here](https://golang.org/doc/install)

This program also uses the gorilla/websocket library that can be found under [https://github.com/gorilla/websocket](https://github.com/gorilla/websocket).

To install the library, run `go get github.com/gorilla/websocket` after you installed go. 

### 1. Cloning the repository

To clone the repository run `git clone https://github.com/TeamBrot/server.git`. If you'd like to use the scripts we provide with our client. Make sure to clone the repository to the same directory, you cloned the client. To get into the repository run `cd server`

### 2. Building the server

Run `go build` at the root level of the repository. If this step fails, make sure you are at the right directory and your go installation works.

### 3. Running the server

Run `./server`. The server is now waiting for connections. After the specified number of players connected, a game starts. You can stop the server by pressing <kbd>Strg</kbd>+<kbd>c</kbd> on your keyboard. For information about the options read the Section Configuration

## Configuration

The server has several configuration options:

- `-h height`: Board height
- `-w width`: Board width
- `-p player`: Number of players (Up to 63)
- `-d minimalDeadline`: Minimal deadline in seconds
- `-o deadlineOffset`: Maximum deadline offset in seconds; maximum deadline is `minimalDeadline + deadlineOffset`. The deadline will be chosen at random.
